PS1 Readme:

Run the following commands to run the simulation using our Listener.
Please follow these instructions because we use an alternate config
file.

$ ant

$ ./runsim 

To add unknown data association, change knownDataAssoc in
eecs568/config/sim.config to false and rerun `runsim'.  To add debug
info during runtime, change debug to 1.
